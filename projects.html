            Presented at the National Conference of Undergraduate Research (NCUR) on April 8th, 2025.
            I led a research team consisting of a myself and several undergraduate and graduate students.
            Our thesis proposed the use of low cost open source materials to create a more effective pipeline to
            manufacture prosthetic
            sockets that would have faster production times and less iterative design for a better fit.
            The pipeline itself is based on various methodologies, in particular, we utilized
            3D scanning technology in conjunction with microcontroller based electronics to facilitate the
            gathering of surface topology and bone protrusion data respectively. By combining this data
            into one space, and using lower cost and open source components, this pipeline
            improves the ease of access to prosthetic manufacturing technology and closes
            the skill gap between prosthetist and patient.

            Utilizing the fabrication technologies at the University of Pittsburgh's Open Lab, I constructed two permanent fixtures for the space to serve
            as functional examples of the capabilities of the lab. The first example is a functional desktop arcade cabinet, which is made from a composite of
            acrylic and plywood, and houses a Raspberry Pi 4 runnning a custom game designed by a fellow lab technician. The second example was an interactable
            information kiosk, housed in a 3D printed casing made to resemble older personal computers of the 1980s. These projects were designed using 
            Fusion360, as well as AutoCAD, and were fabricated using a CO2 50W laser cutter, a handheld CNC router, and FDM 3D printer. These projects are meant to
            draw attention to the lab, as well as showcase how our various technologies can be applied to create functional and engaging projects. They are both
            still active to this day and the arcade cabinet 'Roc Klimber' was featured in Hillman Library's Digital Research Wall, linked here:

            At Mine Vision Systems, we provide mines with advanced scanning equipment using a unique 3D mapping system
            to allow for rapid data collection. The sensor head of the system houses a LIDAR unit, a high end
            camera, a custom build LED board, all powered by a Sensor Head Interface Module (SHIM) via I2C communication.
            I perform diagnostic work on the sensor head, which includes disassembling the unit to replace components,
            in this case, the camera was damaged and needed replacing, requring a full teardown of the sensor head.
            Once reassembled, I then run the sensor head through a series of documented testing procedures to ensure
            full functionality, and at times do sepcific voltage testing on the SHIM to see if any solder rework needs
            to be done.

            An entry for an engineering make-a-thon at the University of Pittsburgh, this project
            was a prototype for a wearable device aimed at OCD symptom management for psychiatric patients.
            The casings were designed using Fusion360 CAD software to house the electronics while being ergonimical,
            yet as compact as possible. The device consisted of a compute module, housing a liquid crystal
            display, some buttons for user input, and a microcontroller and breadboard. The device would be
            activated by the user when they felt a the need to deescalate a compulsion, and would guide
            them through a series of interatcions based on user input. The main module was also removable,
            allowing potential for future modules to be developed. This project was a great opprotunity to test my design and prototyping skills
            under pressure, as we has 48 hours to design, build, and present the prototype to a panel of judges.
            I have since done some deisgn iterations, including more biometric based input and data collection.

            The Sensor Head Interface Module (SHIM) uses I2C communication protocol to interface with 
            the various components of the sensor head, such as the LiDAR unit and the camera. Due to
            design constraints, and the rugged environment the sensor head is used in, the SHIM board 
            is damaged and this frequently results in communication failure between the compute module and 
            sensor head peripherals. Given this is a common point of failure for these boards, the engineering 
            team at Mine Vision Systems has developed a testing rig that is made of the essential components 
            of the sensor head, allowing the SHIM board to be exposed while tested so it is possible to 
            pull voltage differences and check for damaged components. The mounting points and base designed in SOLIDWORKS
            and milled out of aluminum for rigidity, as well as integrating a heat sink for the LED array "Illuminator" board
            due to lack of cooling fans, this test rig allows for isolated testing of each peripheral component to better diagnose the SHIM.

            Diving deeper into my intrigue with older technology and the more analog user interfaces they posses, in addition to my increasing
            disdain for streaming subscriptions, I have begun to apply my fabrication and electronics skills to modify and repair various older
            devices. An example of this is my recent restoration and modification of a 7th generation iPod Classic. Notoriously difficult to repair due to
            the all metal casing, I carefully disassembled, cleaned, and reworked the main board, while acquiring replacement batteries and a new flash
            modification to allow the iPod to interface with higher capacity microSD cards. Taking this a step further, I was able to recreate the faceplate in
            Fusion360, allowing me to 3D print new plastic faceplates, as well as use Fusion360's CAM capabilites to send for machined aluminum faceplates as well.
            After doing this to a  few iPods, I have begun to move to more complex and less supported devices, specifically Nintendo's GameBoy Advance, to test the
            limits of what I can modify and repair with the fabrication and electronics skills I have developed over the years.
